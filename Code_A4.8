Problem Statement 1:

In one state, 52% of the voters are Republicans, and 48% are Democrats. In a second
state, 47% of the voters are Republicans, and 53% are Democrats. Suppose a simple
random sample of 100 voters are surveyed from each state.
What is the probability that the survey will show a greater percentage of Republican
voters in the second state than in the first state?

#P2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the second state i.e .47

#So here the sample var should be zero
